## Setup

### 1. Virtual environment

Ensure you have Python installed, create a virtual environment and activate it.

### 2. Install PyTorch packages

With the virtual environment activated, run

```
pip install -r requirements_pytorch.txt [--index-url INDEX_URL]
```

The `--index-url` should only be specified if advised by https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/.

### 3. Install remaining packages
